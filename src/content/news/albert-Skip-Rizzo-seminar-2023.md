## **Anotace:**

Virtual reality (VR) has undergone a transition in the past 25 years that has taken it from the realm of expensive toy and into that of functional technology. Revolutionary advances in the underlying VR enabling technologies (i.e., computation speed and power, graphics and image rendering technology, display systems, interface devices, immersive audio, haptics tools, tracking, intelligent agents, and authoring software) have supported development resulting in more powerful, low-cost VR systems. Such advances in technological “prowess” and accessibility have provided the hardware platforms needed for the conduct of human clinical treatment and research within more usable, useful, and lower cost VR systems. Since the mid-1990s, a significant scientific literature has also evolved regarding the outcomes from the use of what we now refer to as Clinical Virtual Reality (VR). This use of VR simulation technology has produced encouraging results when applied to address cognitive, psychological, motor, and functional impairments across a wide range of clinical health conditions. This presentation will focus on seven ways that Clinical VR has already, and will continue to change the world of Mental Healthcare. After a brief orientation to the relevant elements that comprise Clinical VR, the talk will review the theory, research, and application of VR systems that help to overcome fear, recover from traumatic experiences, experience less pain, rehabilitate motor function, exercise and relax, test and train cognitive function, and benefit from virtual human interaction. The clinical health conditions that benefit from these applications include patients with Anxiety Disorders, Depression, PTSD, Acute/Chronic Pain, TBI, Autism, ADHD, Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, social skill challenges, and other clinical conditions. In each application area, I will present the trajectory of Clinical VR over the last 25 years and address the question of whether Clinical VR is ready for Primetime. This will focus on the question of readiness regarding the theoretical basis for Clinical VR applications, the scientific research to date, and the pragmatic factors regarding availability, usability, and costs of Clinical VR content/systems. While there is still much research needed to advance the science in this area, I will make the case that Clinical VR applications are in fact “ready for primetime” and will soon become indispensable tools in the toolbox of healthcare researchers and practitioners. I will conclude with a look at future trends that are expected to continue to will grow in relevance and popularity in the near future as the technology continues to evolve. The lecture will also include current activities related to the war conflict in Ukraine.

**The lecture will be combined with practical demonstrations of VR applications.**
