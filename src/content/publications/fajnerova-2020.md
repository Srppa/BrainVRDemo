### Abstrakt

Deficits in neurocognitive mechanisms such as inhibition control and cognitive flexibility have been suggested to mediate the symptoms in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). These mechanisms are proposedly controlled by the “affective” and “executive” orbitofronto-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits with well-documented morphological and functional alterations in OCD that are associated with OCD symptoms. The precuneus region has been suggested in OCD as another key structure associated with the mechanism of “thought–action fusion.” Our study aimed to elucidate the association of the altered functional coupling of the CSTC nodes (and precuneus), the OCD symptoms, and interference control/cognitive flexibility.
