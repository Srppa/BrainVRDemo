### Abstrakt

Schizophrenia  has  a  debilitating  impact  on  patient , s  cognitive  functioning  and  everyday activities. As a part of the treatment,  schizophrenia patients attend sessions of cogni - tive  remediation  to  restore  impaired  cognitive  abilities. To combine cognitive and real life train - ing, this study presents a virtual task to use in  cognitive rehabilitation and assessment. Virtual  Supermarket Shopping Task (VSST) simulates a  shopping activity, in which participants have to  memorize and collect items from a virtual super - market. The aim of this study is to establish its  validity for use in clinical practice. Sample  and  setting.   Twenty patients suffering  from chronic schizophrenia and twenty healthy  controls were tested. Each participant complet - ed the task and a battery of standard neuropsy - chological tests. Statistical  analyses.  Groups’ results were com - pared by Student’s t-tests. Validity of  VSST was  examined using correlations with standard neu - ropsychological  measures.  Several  VSST  met - rics, such as trial difficulty, distances and times,  and the effect the extraneous variables have on  VSST measures were investigated using analyses  of variance and mixed effect models. Results.  The analyses demonstrate that patients  perform worse in VSST than healthy controls  and their performance corresponds to their mne - monic abilities measured by standard neuropsy - chological  tests. VSST  performance  relates  to  the level of executive functioning only in pa - tients. There was no effect of gaming experience  on VSST performance. While potential gender  effect has to be addressed in future studies, age  seems  to  play  a  role  in  the  additional  VSST  measures (trial time and distance). Study  limitations.   Subjects  were  tested  only  once and therefore long term benefits of using  VSST in rehabilitation could not be investigat - ed. Only schizophrenia patients were included  in the sample, which reduces generalizability  of results to other psychiatric and neurologic  conditions.
