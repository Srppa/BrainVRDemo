Mgr. Anna Francová graduated in psychology from the Faculty of Education at Charles University in Prague, and is currently a doctoral student in Neuroscience at the Faculty of Medicine of the same university. Within the NUDZ, she has been working as a junior researcher, focusing on the clinical applications of virtual reality, particularly in patients with anxiety disorders. Her work primarily involves planning exposure therapies for patients with OCD and phobias, contributing to the development of applications in virtual reality, and preparing experiments. As part of her doctoral studies, she explores the use of virtual reality as a means of eliciting stress responses in individuals with personality disorders. She has completed research internships abroad in Budapest, England, and Berlin. She is interested in evaluating the effectiveness of psychotherapy and expressive techniques, particularly dramatherapy.
