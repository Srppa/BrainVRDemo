Bc. Tereza Langová graduated from the Faculty of Information Technology at the Czech Technical University with a degree in Computer Graphics, and is currently pursuing a Master's degree in the same field at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering at CTU. She has been developing games in her free time for more than two years, mostly creating graphics and designing user interfaces, but occasionally programming as well.

At NUDZ, her main focus is on creating graphics for VR scenes.
