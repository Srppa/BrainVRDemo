I graduated from Theoretical Research Psychology at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Charles University, and I am applying for a doctoral degree in psychology. I am starting to work as a VR psychologist at the VR Center at the National University of Prague. In addition to working at the National University of Prague, I also teach social psychology at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences and act as the secretary of the Master's program in Social and Cultural Ecology at the Faculty of Humanities. In my free time, I enjoy curling at a semi-professional level and sports in general.
