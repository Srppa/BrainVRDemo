Memory decline – associated with physiological aging and age-related neurological disorders – has a direct impact on the quality of life of the elderly. With an aging demographic, the diagnosis of cognitive function gains importance, as early diagnosis can lead to more effective cognitive interventions. Compared to classical pen-and-paper approaches, virtual reality (VR) could offer an ecologically valid tool for the assessment of cognitive deficit and its subsequent rehabilitation. VR can be presented with different degrees of immersion, which affects the perceived degree of presence in the virtual environment. VR can thus be presented in a less immersive form, using a computer monitor, or with more advanced technologies such as a VR headset that provides a highly immersive presentation. Both of these VR technologies come with certain advantages and disadvantages. The results of studies focusing on the role of immersion in the assessment of cognitive performance and the use of immersive VR in an aging population are ambiguous.

In this project, we investigated age-related differences between using a VR headset and a computer monitor to examine memory using a within-subject design.

The group of seniors (N = 36) and young adults (N = 25) completed a virtual task in a supermarket using a computer monitor and a VR headset in random order. Our results showed that seniors' performance was better when using a computer monitor. The ability to recall a shopping list in the young adult group remained stable regardless of the technology used. It seemed that the participants' performance when using the VR headset was more affected by fatigue in both groups. User-friendliness ratings did not differ between the two technologies, and side effects (so-called cyber sickness) were reported only exceptionally. This meant that immersive VR was well accepted by the senior population. These findings may be particularly important for the further use of VR headsets for cognitive diagnosis and rehabilitation.

The project was developed in cooperation with 3dsense s.r.o.
