The goal of this project is the development of a virtual reality (VR) application designated for exposure therapy of specific phobias (e.g., fear of heights, claustrophobia, or aviophobia), agoraphobia, and social phobia set in a complex environment of a virtual city. The city environment has been chosen because the patients' symptoms with specific phobias are often tied to situations typical of the city environment (e.g., the already mentioned fear of heights, fear of medical equipment, or fear of traveling by public transport). In the virtual environment, the user can move naturally from one environment to another, so the application can be easily used even by people with several phobias. At the beginning of the therapy, a plan is prepared together with the patient, describing which situations they will gradually learn to handle. Emphasis is placed on mapping situations that the patient avoids in everyday life. In the case of claustrophobia, the therapy can be started, for example, by staying in an elevator with the doors open, and in subsequent sessions, staying in a closed elevator and then dealing with unpleasant situations, such as a malfunction of the elevator. As part of social phobia therapy, the patient can be placed in a subway environment with an adjustable number of people or in a cinema environment, in which the difficulty of the therapy can again be increased in different manners (e.g., presentation in front of the audience, sitting in the middle of the auditorium).

The application can be connected to the physiological measurement of heart activity and breathing, which allows the therapist to respond better to the current state of anxiety and increase the difficulty of the exposure only if the patient is able to manage the current situation. The possibilities of using this feedback are currently being examined.

The project is being developed in cooperation with the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics and the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering of the Czech Technical University (CTU) with the financial support from the ETA programme of the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic (TACR), project No. TL03000223.
