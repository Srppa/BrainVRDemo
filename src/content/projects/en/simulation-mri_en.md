Magnetic resonance imaging plays an important role in neurological, oncological and other clinical examinations. However, anxiety, claustrophobia and other worries are often the reason for reluctance to undergo a given examination. They can also lead to unpleasant feelings before or during the examination or even reduce the quality of the output (especially if the patient moves during the scan) or prevent its implementation. It is often possible for the patient to undergo the examination only after the medication has been administered.

The goal of this project is the development of a VR application that simulates – as faithfully as possible – the entire process that a patient must undergo before a magnetic resonance examination. The virtual environment accurately simulates the MRI laboratory of the National Institute of Mental Health CZ (NIMH CZ). After putting on the VR headset and starting the application, the user finds himself in the waiting room and is guided by the staff through the entire examination process, including preparations, instructions and sensations associated with the examination in the magnetic resonance tunnel.

The project is being carried out with the support of the internal grant of the NIMH CZ, No. NUDZ 318A_2020.
