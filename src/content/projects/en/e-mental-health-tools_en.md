The project is devoted to the use of e-mental health tools (e-mental health: the use of the Internet and digital technologies to provide information and services within the framework of mental health care) in the prevention of mental health disorders and the treatment of mental illnesses. The goal of the project is to develop new e-mental health tools that would be suitable and available for the Czech population. Within these goals, we focus on the development and utilization of virtual reality (VR), for example, in the form of a self-guided VR relaxation application, virtual environments for exposure therapy for anxiety disorders (subproject VZ4.2 VR methods for psychotherapy and prevention of anxiety disorders), and online platforms for cognitive training using VR (subproject VZ4.3 Online support of healthy aging through cognitive training with VR elements). Individual applications will enable the user to learn and practice relaxing breathing using biofeedback, to expose themselves to feared stimuli, and to practice memory and attention through virtual reality.
