Our VR center is also interested in the development of episodic memory, which is why we adapted our studies to preschool children and adolescents. The goal of this project was to study episodic memory in children by comparing the development of individual components of memory of episodic type; and comparing episodic memory to other types of memory.

A short study was conducted with children of preschool age, where they performed the task of collecting objects in 2D environment, 3D environment, and also in the real environment of a kindergarten. Behavioral data indicated that there was a difference in the difficulty of individual components of episodic memory in children.
