Application VR BREATHing helps to practice rhythmic deep breathing crucial for relaxation and meditation techniques. The five to five seconds rhythm is applied as this rhythm demonstrated beneficial effects on human physical and mental health.
Moreover, breathing is not the only feature you can practice thanks to this application, it can be also used to increase so called mindfulness.
Mindfulness is a human ability to be aware of the present moment.
While following the rhythmical pattern of breathing, we have to focus our attention to maintain it correctly. Thanks to this focused activity, our mindfulness ability is spontaneously increasing. This virtual application should help mainly individuals, who are struggling with standard breathing and mindfulness practices, as they can be often hard to follow. Virtual reality and relaxation sound of our app brings you to a controlled environment, where you can focus just on your breathing, without interruptions from the stressful world around you.
This application is free and ready to use for anyone who has HTC VIVE or Lenovo Mirage Solo.
Enjoy...
Future development: The app will be soon available also for mobile HMD devices.
