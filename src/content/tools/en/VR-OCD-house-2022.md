OCD House - The virtual house is aimed for exposure therapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in immersive virtual reality. Thanks to immersive VR, the therapeutic application enables direct interaction with stimuli activated in the environment of the virtual house and garden. During exposure therapy, stimuli can be freely combined involving common objects and situations in the home that may trigger OCD symptoms, including hoarding. Target stimuli (VR elements) are divided into several sets corresponding to OCD subtypes. During the session, the therapist can modify the level of difficulty via four standardized levels according to the individual needs of clients.
